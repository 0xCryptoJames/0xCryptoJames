- [GamerBoom](https://github.com/Rinku-link) - a Web3 gaming social hub built upon infinite mainstream games.
GamerBoom is a Web3 gaming social hub that integrates seamlessly with a multitude of mainstream games. Our current product matrix primarily consists of two parts: **GamerBoom Client** and **Rinku Protocol**. 

The **GamerBoom Client** is tailored to provide traditional gamers with effortless access to the Web3 realm, allowing them to earn rewards while gaming without disrupting their gaming experience. In contrast, the **Rinku Protocol** is a decentralized gaming social protocol based on a bonding curve mechanism. It is designed to incentivize the creation of user-generated content (UGC) and enhance gaming social interactions within the community.
